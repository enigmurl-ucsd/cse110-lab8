## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers
Graceful degradation and service workers are related because service workers can be used to help implement graceful degradation features. Graceful degradation refers to the design principle where an application maintains limited functionality even when parts of it fail or certain resources are unavailable. Service workers play a key role in this by managing network requests and caching assets, which ensures that essential parts of the application remain functional even without a network connection. In particular, rather than an application completely breaking without network, only minimal features that absolutely require the network can be disabled, whereas the main crux of the application can still use service workers to provide something of use. Therefore, service workers are an integral part (but not the sole method) to provide accesibility to all users in the topic of graceful degradation.
